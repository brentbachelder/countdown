## Goal of the Project
Drag-and-drop is used in a lot of business facing sites. I personally use it in the TechShopPOS, but I wanted to make sure I completely understood the concept. What should I make with drag-and-drop? That's right. A British game show! Enjoy, see if you can get a good score. Nine is the highest I got. [Try it here](https://codepen.io/brentbachelder/full/gOKJMPK)
